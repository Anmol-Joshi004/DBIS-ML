# DBIS-ML
This repository contains a spam detection project implemented in Python using various classification algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms and create a user-friendly web interface using Flask for detecting spam emails. The project structure includes a data/ directory for the training dataset, a spam_detection.py script for model training and evaluation, and a web_app/ directory that houses the Flask application along with HTML templates and static files for styling. To get started, ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages listed in requirements.txt. First, navigate to the project directory and run the spam_detection.py script to train the models and evaluate their performance. After training, run the Flask application from the web_app directory and open your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the spam detection interface, where you can enter email text and determine if it is spam.
